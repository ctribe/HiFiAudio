use this file to list all the tasks we need to resolve

- need to decide on source resistors on push pull
	i already picked some out. they are in the digikey cart------- Cameron 
	-change footprint in Eagle
- need to decide if we are only going to have one bass filter and distribute the output to all PAs
	we may be able to sum both channels before filtering (only necessary if both channels do not carry bass- unlikely)
	diode this we eliminate 1 opamp (with bypass components) and the filters will only need to wire 1 set of the double
	gang pot 
- need to decide on connectors so schematic moves forward
- need to start filling in all component values
- need a BOM with digikey part numbers and prices
- start design of SMPS
- add component values to Eagle Schematic
