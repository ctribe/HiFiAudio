This document describes the coloring scheme used to wire
the ouput and Vbe multiplier transistors


This are teh colors of the wires of each individual trasistor
for MOSFETs
purple -> gate
red -> drain
yellow -> source

for BJTs Carlos
red -> emitter
orange -> collector
blue -> base

for BJTs Cameron
black -> emitter
green -> collector
blue -> base


Carlos
This are the colors of teh bundle of wires per transsitor
i.e. gate, drain, source
PMOS blue tie
NMOS green tie

This are the colors that tell which transsitors are for what channel
right - burgandy
left - purple
bass - yellow
