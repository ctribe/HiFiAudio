use this file to list all the tasks we need to resolve

- need to decide on source resisitors on pushpull
	i already picked some out. they are in the digikey cart------- Cameron 
- need to decide if we are only going to have one bass filter and distribute the output to all PAs
	we may be able to sum both channels before filtering (only neccesary if both channels do not carry bass- unlikely)
	doidn this we elimante 1 opamp (with bypass components) and the filters will only need to wire 1 set of the double
	gang pot 
- need to decide on connectors so schematic moves forward
- need to start filling in all component values
- need a BOM with digikey part nunmbers and prices
- start design of SMPS
